    "### Context  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Airbnb, as “Air Bed and Breakfast”, provides an online marketplace to allow property owners to rent out their spaces for people to stay. “Inside Airbnb” collects information on properties rented and data of renting activities from Airbnb. Its goals are to give insights on Airbnb business and improve property owners and renters' experiences during their uses of Airbnb. The Chief Executive Officer makes the business decision and report to the stakeholders.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Need  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Airbnb needs to improve the method to determine the listing price of a property for rent. Factors influencing the listing price need to be identified. Using the data collected by “Inside Airbnb” and other data sources, and building up a better model using these factors to predict the listing price of properties for rent, the company will generate more reasonable listing prices and this will attract more users including both property owners and renters.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Vision  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The Chief Executive Officer will get a set of spreadsheets that contain the data categorized by property information and renting activities based on transaction history. Models using different factors to predict listing prices of properties will be generated. The best model will be selected based on the evaluation.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Outcome  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Factors in the best model that predict listing prices will be focused in the future. Different aspects of these factors will be investigated and conresponding data will be collected for further exploration. A report of a discussion of factors impacting listing prices will be sent to the Chief Executive Officer and will be discussed at the next Business meeting. The results will be reported to stakeholders.  \n",

    "## Interesting Variables  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We explored single variable distributions and pair-wise variables for their correlations with the target variable price in our EDA. The most interesting variables are those that have at least a low correlation (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient r >= 0.30) with the target variable price. They are:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* bedrooms: The bedrooms variable is a numerical integer value. It represents the number of bedrooms of properties. More bedrooms generally corresponds to a higher capacity for overnight guests. 75% of AirBnB listings in the DC area contain two or fewer bedrooms. There is one AirBnB that has a maximum number of bedrooms of 15. The distribution of the number of bedrooms appears to be right-skewed. This makes sense, as one or two bedrooms may be common for most homes, with 3 or more bedrooms being less commons in homes, especially in a densely-populated area. There is a low positive relationship (r = 0.39) between bedrooms and price and that Spearman's suggests that the relationship may not be linear.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* beds: The variable beds is a numerical integer value. It represents the number of beds in the AirBnb listed property. It may correlate with bedrooms since number of bedrooms usually equals to that of beds except for rare cases. Thus, we can say about 75% of AirBnB listings in the DC area contain two or fewer beds. There is one AirBnB that has a maximum number of beds of 15.  More beds generally corresponds to a higher capacity for overnight guests. There is a low positive relationship (r = 0.42) between beds and price and that Spearman's suggests that the relationship may not be linear.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* accommodates: The accommodates variable is a numerical integer value. It represents the number of people who can stay in the AirBnb listed property. More accommodates generally corresponds to a higher capacity for overnight guests. 75% of AirBnB listings in the DC area are capable of accomodating 4 people. This unsurprisingly folows a similar pattern to both the beds and bedroom variables. The data are right-skewed. Even number accommodates values are more common, which makes sense given that one bed is often counted as accommodating 2 guests. There is a moderate positive relationship (r = 0.51) between accommodates and price and that Spearman's suggests that the relationship may be linear.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* num_baths: The number of bathrooms in an AirBnB is a categorical value, since AirBnbs can have \"shared\" or \"private\" bathrooms. Additionally, there may be \"half-baths\" as well. The most common bathroom type for Airbnb is \"1 bath\". There is a low positive relationship (r = 0.47) between num_baths and price and that Spearman's suggests that the relationship may not be linear.  \n",

    "## Null Model / Baseline Model  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As shown in our EDA, there are 8626 listings between Q2 2022- Q1 2023 in Washington D.C. The average price of these AirBnBs is 166 US dollars with a standard deviation of 130 US dollars. The mininum price for a place is 0 dollars and the max is 999 dollars. We can definitely see a skew right since the median (130) < mean (166).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As noted in our EDA, the distribution of this variable is skewed right and not normally distributed. It is important to understand the context of why the data is being generated like this. The data does not contains a \"bell shaped curve\" that is partly tied to the central limit theorem. That is, the average of the observations of this variable with finite moment and 2nd moment do not converges to the normal distribution as the number of sample increases. The data is postively skewed. That is the median of the observations is lower than the mean. There are more observations on the lower 50% percentile of the dataset than the upper 50% percentile. In this situaiton, there is no symmetry in the bell curve which violates the normality assumptions and takes us to transform the distribution we want to fit for our model. Since the data reflects the time of a pricing for a particular listing. This might be considered as the spatial time between events and it makes sense.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Data Generating Story  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The price listing of Airbnbs varies significantly based on the demand for that specific unit. With this said, it can be noted that the demand for Airbnbs is high for Airbnbs that are cheaper and there is gradually less demand for Airbnbs that are more expensive. However, it is important to note that there is a point in the Airbnbs where the demand is as low as expensive Airbnb. That is, Airbnbs that are too cheap, people do not want to rent this Airbnb. Thus, as mentioned, because these prices are within a timeframe and are independent from each other, this distribution is most likely an exponential distribution or a family of the exponential distribution.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Null Model / Baseline Model  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We would predict that the mean listing price is 166.80 dollars. The standard deviation of the price using 75% error bounds is (-94.82, 428.43).  \n",
