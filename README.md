# Group 4 Project Files for EN.685.648

<<<<<<< HEAD
"contents.txt" shows the folders contained within the repo. Primary AirBnB dataset can be found
within "data/primary", and secondary data set can be found within "data/secondary".

### Running the "datawarehouse.py" SQL file
In order to pull the data from GitHub for the primary dataset, you need to have Git LFS 
(Large File Storage) installed. There are instructions on installing for Mac,
Windows, and Linux, located 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/configuring-git-large-file-storage).

Once Git LFS is installed, run `conda activate en385648` and then, in a terminal window, navigate to the data folder
and run `python datawarehouse.py`. The .sql and .db files are also included in this repo, so it this is optional.
